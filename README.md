To begin, I needed a dataset. I searched Google for images of potholes on highways, carefully selecting relevant images for my research. After hours of searching, I managed to collect only 15 images—far from an ideal dataset but sufficient to take the first step. These images varied in resolution and came in different file formats (JPEG, JFIF, etc.), adding an extra challenge to the process.

Next, I uploaded the dataset to Roboflow, where I meticulously labeled each pothole. This step was crucial in ensuring the model learned to recognize them accurately. Once the labeling was complete, I prepared the dataset for training and exported it into the YOLOv8-compatible format.

After training the model, I put it to the test, and the results were surprisingly good! The YOLOv8 model successfully detected potholes on the road. While the model performed well, there were some limitations. Due to the small dataset size and inconsistent image quality, the model occasionally struggled with accuracy, sometimes confusing potholes with dark patches or shadows.
